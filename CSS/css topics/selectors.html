<h1>external css</h1>
<p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the
 link element, inside the head section.
 An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.
The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.</p>

<p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

<h1 style="background-color:brown";> combinator selectors</h1>

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector.
 Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.</P>
